Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method? <br>
`O(n)` <br>
<br>
2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function? <br>
`O(n)` <br>
<br>
3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? <br>
`O(n)` <br>
<br>
4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? <br>
`O(n)` <br>
<br>
5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function? <br>
`O(log n)` <br>
<br>
6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array? <br>
`O(1)`
